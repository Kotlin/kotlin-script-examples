# Kotlin scripting examples

This repository contains example projects and individual scripts, as well as links to the external examples 
demonstrating Kotlin Scripting functionality and API usage.

If you know good examples of the Kotlin scripting API usage, not mentioned here, please submit an issue or a pull 
request with the link and short description.  

## Examples in this repository

The complete project could be compiled with Gradle, as well as imported e.g. in IntelliJ IDEA.

The individual example projects are mostly independent and could be copied and reused independently, but build files
should be adapted accordingly, mostly to supply required Kotlin version properties and setup inter-project dependencies
when needed
